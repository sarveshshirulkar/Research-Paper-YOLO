Adaptive traffic signal management using real-time vehicle detection and tracking

Abstract : Traffic congestion is a significant issue in urban
 cities, as it restricts traffic flow, increases fuel consumption,
 and produces high emissions. Traditional traffic signal systems
 work on fixed timing without considering real-time variations
 in traffic and often worsen the problem. This paper describes
 an adaptive traffic signal control system based on the YOLO
 (You Only Look Once) algorithm, using object detection for real
time signal timing in response to real-time traffic. The system
 applies real-time vehicle detection and tracking at intersections
 for dynamic management of green light time according to volume
 and vehicle type. The proposed approach makes vehicle recogni
tion significantly efficient and responds quickly to the change in
 traffic situation. The paper discusses the design, implementation,
 and evaluation of performance in a simulated environment. The
 results demonstrate improved traffic management and reduced
 congestion, offering a promising solution to smart city traffic
 control.
